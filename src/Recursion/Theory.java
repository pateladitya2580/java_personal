package Recursion;
/*
Recursion = A function calling itself with different parameters and a base case to terminate
the infinite loop.

* In recursion ,we solve a bigger problem by solving smaller subproblem.
   Functions . problem
             . subproblem
   THE RECURSION SPELL
   1. Identify the smaller problem/recursive work (let recursion solve it)
   2. Self work - Do you work
   3. Identify the base case - smallest problem for which the ans is obvious
